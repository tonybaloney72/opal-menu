Somehow two hours wasn't enough time! I had so many ideas.

Things I wanted to do:
I wanted to make the order itself a modal with the total price
I wanted to be able to remove items from the your order
I wanted better styling through out the app
I wanted to write more and better tests

Things I would have done differently:
I was stuck on using localStorage for a bit of time, I figured it'd be an easier approach than passing state objects and setters from component to component but that ended up being a pretty large waste of time unfortunately.
